# briw
Tea and coffee and other drinks hopefully.

Please note: The `briw` directory is a work-in-progress and does not currently run. Details below. 

# TO RUN THE PROGRAM
In the root directory run:```python3 fav_drinks.py```

You will be presented with a menu from which you can add people, choose drinks, set favourites - all that fun stuff!

# CONTRIBUTING
Please contribute, it's fun! Just submit a pull-request and I'll have a look. Just _beware_ if you're trying to mess with the `briw` directory (more details below).

# THE NOT-SO-SECRET BRIW DIRECTORY
I have slowly been extracting my functionality into different modules, and trying to OOP-ify my data, but it's all a bit of a mess right now! 

If you would like to edit some files in here, that would be great, just don't expect anything else to run properly alongside them!
